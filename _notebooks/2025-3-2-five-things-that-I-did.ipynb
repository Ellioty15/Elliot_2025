Over the past twelve weeks, I was able to take on a variety of tasks that helped me grow not just as a programmer, but also as a collaborator within my team. I felt that these features that I implemented were helpful and powerful within our social media website. Here's a look back at five key things I focused on:\n"

    "## 1. Frontend Gemini Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "One of my first major tasks was building a **frontend for Gemini**, Google’s AI model. I integrated a user-friendly interface where users could easily enter prompts and receive responses directly from Gemini. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project taught me a lot about how to handle form inputs, display API results on the frontend, and manage the flow of data between the user and the AI. Designing the layout and making it intuitive was a fun challenge that tested my creativity and ability to design a professional site. It has helped me understand the importance of frontend design in making powerful tools usable.\n",

    "## 2. Backend Gemini API and SQLAlchemy Table\n",
    "\n",
    "To support the frontend, I also developed a **backend API for Gemini**. This handled requests from the frontend and communicated with the Gemini model to process user inputs and return generated results. I got an API key for gemini through google. An error that I ran into was running out of key uses, so I had to refresh the key a couple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of that, I created a **SQLAlchemy database table** to store the Gemini interactions. This meant that not only were we able to generate responses, but we could also save and track conversations in our database for later use. I stored both user and AI messages, and the id of the messages. This was done through my model, in which I declared what I wanted my columns to store. \n",

Big Idea 4 was related as we used the internet to access AWS for deployment. "
