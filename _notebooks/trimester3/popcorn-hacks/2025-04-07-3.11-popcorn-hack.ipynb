    "- The procedure <code>BinarySearch(numList, target)</code> correctly implements a binary search algorithm on the list of numbers <code>numList</code>. The procedure returns an index here <code>target</code> occurs in numList, or <code>-1</code> if <code>target</code> does not occur in <code>numList</code>. Which of the following conditions must be met in order for the procedure to work as intended? Explain why.\n",
