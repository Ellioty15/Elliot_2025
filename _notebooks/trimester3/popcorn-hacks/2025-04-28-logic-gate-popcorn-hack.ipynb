    "### Example 1: Security Alarm System (Using Logic Gates)\n",
    "- A house alarm uses an OR gate.\n",
    "- If door opens OR window breaks an alarm will sounds\n",
    "\n",
    "Why logic gates help:\n",
    "- The OR gate makes it so either problem (door or window) triggers protection.\n",
    "- It keeps homes safe by detecting any break-in fast.\n",

    "### Example 2: Traffic Light Controller (Using Logic Gates)\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "- A city traffic light uses AND gates and NOT gates.\n",
    "- If car at intersection AND timer says green → Light turns green.\n",
    "- If no cars (NOT car detected) → Keep light red or switch faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traffic flows smoothly without wasting time.\n",
    "- Prevents crashes and saves gas by reducing long wait times at empty intersections.\n",
