    "## 1. The Official Question\n",
    "\n",
    "You will implement 3 static methods in a `Hailstone` class that deal with a mathematical sequence called the **Hailstone sequence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence is defined as:\n",
    "- If `n == 1`, the sequence ends.\n",
    "- If `n` is even → next = `n / 2`\n",
    "- If `n` is odd  → next = `3n + 1`\n",

    "Return the **number of terms** in the hailstone sequence starting at `n`.  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part (b) — `isLongSeq(int n)`\n",
    "Return `true` if the sequence is **long**, meaning its length is **greater than the starting value**.  \n",
    "Ex: `isLongSeq(5)` → `true` because `6 > 5`.  \n",
    "    `isLongSeq(8)` → `false` because `4 ≤ 8`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part (c) — `propLong(int n)`\n",
    "Return the **proportion of long sequences** from `1` through `n`.  \n",
    "Use `isLongSeq` in your implementation.  \n",
    "Ex: `propLong(10)` → `0.5` because 5 of the first 10 numbers produce long sequences.\n",

    "\n",
    "-  **Use loops over recursion** to avoid stack overflow and make it easier to count steps.\n",
    "-  In part (a), **loop until `n == 1`**, updating `n` based on parity.\n",
    "-  In part (b), call `hailstoneLength(n)` and compare the result to `n`.\n",
    "-  In part (c), use a counter and loop from 1 to `n`, checking `isLongSeq(i)`. Return `count / (double) n` for the proportion.\n",
    "-  **Avoid hardcoding values**. Your methods should work for any `n > 0`.\n",
