    "# Undecidable Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "An undecidable problem is a problem for which no algorithm can be constructed that will always provide a correct yes/no answer for all possible inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Characteristics\n",
    "1. No single algorithm can always provide a correct answer.\n",
    "2. Some instances may have a solution, but no algorithm can solve all instances.\n",
    "3. A classic example is the Halting Problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: The Halting Problem\n",
    "- Introduced by Alan Turing.\n",
    "- Asks whether a given computer program will eventually stop (halt) or continue running forever when given a specific input.\n",
    "- Turing proved it is impossible to create an algorithm that can determine whether every possible program will halt or run forever.\n",
    "- Sometimes a program might take an unreasonable amount of time to reach an endingâ€”if it even exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Analogy: A Website Taking Too Long to Load\n",
    "- Imagine clicking on a website, and it just keeps loading indefinitely.\n",
    "- Question: Is the page just taking a long time, or will it never load?\n",
    "- There is no general way to determine if the website will ever finish loading.\n",
    "- Similar to the Halting Problem, we cannot predict for all cases whether a webpage will load successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Decidable Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "A decidable problem is a problem for which an algorithm can always be written to provide a correct yes/no output for any input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Characteristics\n",
    "1. An algorithm exists that solves every possible case of the problem.\n",
    "2. The algorithm always terminates with a correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "- Checking if a number is divisible by 3.\n",

    "### 1. Introduction to Graphs  \n",
    "A graph is a data structure used to represent relationships between objects.  \n",
    "A graph consists of:  \n",
    "- Nodes (Vertices):** The entities being connected.  \n",
    "- Edges: The connections or relationships between nodes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Graphs  \n",
    "1. **Undirected Graphs:**  \n",
    "   - Edges are bidirectional.  \n",
    "   - Example: Facebook friendships.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unweighted Graphs:**  \n",
    "   - All edges are considered equal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Directed Graphs:**  \n",
    "   - Edges have direction.  \n",
    "   - Example: Twitter followers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Weighted Graphs:**  \n",
    "   - Edges have values like distance or cost.  \n",
    "   - Example: Road networks.  \n",

    "---\n",

    "### Applications of Graphs  \n",
    "- **Social Networks:** Connecting users and their relationships.  \n",
    "- **Navigation Systems:** Finding the shortest route in apps like Google Maps.  \n",
    "- **Recommendation Systems:** Suggesting content on platforms like Netflix.\n",

    "### 3. Heuristics  \n",
    "A **heuristic** is a problem-solving strategy that simplifies solutions using rules of thumb, rather than exact, exhaustive search.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Example  \n",
    "- **Brute Force:** Search every shelf one by one.  \n",
    "- **Heuristic:** Go straight to the Science section if looking for a science book.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Heuristic Algorithms  \n",
    "- **Greedy Algorithms:** Always pick the best immediate option.  \n",
    "- **A\\* Search:** Finds the shortest or quickest path from one point to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Application of Heuristics  \n",
    "- **Navigation Systems:**  \n",
    "  - Google Maps uses heuristic-based approximations for shortest routes (e.g., Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm).\n",

    "### Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)  \n",
    "A famous optimization problem that asks:  \n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Given a set of cities and the distances between them, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting point?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Small Example:  \n",
    "- **Nearest Neighbor Algorithm:**  \n",
    "  - A greedy heuristic often used for approximation.  \n",
    "  - Fast but does not guarantee the shortest path.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "#### Large Example:  \n",
    "- Solving for large numbers of cities becomes computationally impossible through brute-force.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is TSP Hard?  \n",
    "- **Number of Routes:** For **n** cities, the total routes = **(n-1)!**  \n",
    "- As **n** increases, the route count grows exponentially, making brute-force infeasible.\n",
