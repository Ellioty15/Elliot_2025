    "State Management: Using a boolean like isTeam1Active is a very efficient way to handle a \"toggle\" system. It makes the recordPlay logic clean because ythere are only two states to worry about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logic in recordPlay: use of the exclamation point (!isTeam1Active) to flip the boolean is the idiomatic way to handle switches in Java. concise and prevents from having to write if (isTeam1Active) { isTeam1Active = false; }.\n",

    "String Formatting: In getScore(), String Concatenation is used. By combining integers (team1Score) with string literals (\"-\"), Java automatically converts numbers into strings to build the final output."
