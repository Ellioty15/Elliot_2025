    "# My Future in Computer Science\n",
    "\n",
    "### What I Learned\n",
    "Taking AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) has truly expanded my understanding of computer science beyond just coding. I find it intriguing that almost everything runs on some sort of code, and I like to contemplate how people approached their projects. Itâ€™s been an eye-opening experience that has not only broadened my knowledge but also equipped me with critical thinking and collaboration skills through group projects. This class has also taught me that in order to approach large tasks, I should split them into subtasks and take a consistent approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the introduction to Agile and Scrum methodologies has prepared me for future coursework and real-world applications, especially after hearing college students describe how their experiences in AP CSP helped them transition smoothly into college assignments. Attending the college panel has helped me understand my next steps in high school in order to have a better chance in College. I talked to Edwin Abraham, and he suggested that I join clubs inside or outside of school, that has lead me to join UCSD's Cyber ACM club(unofficially). I have also planned hackathons with Aranya Bhattacharya, and I have a project in mind for the summer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next year, I'll be taking AP Computer Science A (CSA), which will further enhance my programming abilities. I think that the things I learned this trimester will provide a strong foundation for next trimester and next year, especially the collaboration aspect and addressing the challenges of working in a group, rather than working by myself.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am also be studying cybersecurity. By taking Google's Cybsersecurity course, I was able to learn more about things like the CLI and GUIs and also how to use Linux and SQL, as well as internet protocols that keep networks and corporations secure. I was glad that the things I learned in CSP this trimester also showed up in the working world more often than I thought.\n",
    "\n",
    "Career wise, I believe that CSP has provided a stronger basis of code that has allowed me to get hired at Code Ninjas. It was something that I talked about on my resume, and I think that my experience working with other people as well has given me the qualification to learn and teach coding to younger students."
