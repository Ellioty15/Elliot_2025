    "### 1.1 Collaboration\n",
    "Collaboration is the biggest recurring concept in our CSP class. In a group of 6, we used Agile and Scrum methods in order to create an efficient team that is able to function and get its work done. Without collaboration and communication especially, our group would not have been able to be successful in the class. I had always thought that coding was a one man job where someone was shut into an office by themselves, but now I'm realizing that no good website can come from a single person who refuses to work with others. In order to maximize our efforts, we created a kanban board and frequently chatted within our slack groupchat. \n",
    "\n",
    "I think we really stepped up our collaboration when we started having **stand up meetings**. before, our group would constantly be losing out on points because we assumed that everyone had understood their roles, but on the day of the review we were all scrambling to figure our what we were presenting and how to show our work. This allowed us to establish better connections and a more encouraging environment, and I was excited to share my ideas to my group because I knew that they would consider them."

By frequently using the debug function of main.py and using tools like copilot, we were able to detect lines of code where things had gone wrong. We also used postman to test our code, and when we saw error messages we were able to identify issues with our code. Some examples were that our code wasn't going to the correct endpoint, or our crud functions were wrong. \n",
