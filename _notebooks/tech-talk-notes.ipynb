    "## Three Choices for UI Design:  \n",
    "1. **Use a GitHub Pages Theme (Mandatory)**  \n",
    "   - A GitHub Pages theme provides a pre-built design for your site.  \n",
    "   - Examples: Minima, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Responsive Design**  \n",
    "   - The UI should dynamically adjust as the window resizes.  \n",
    "   - Elements should reposition and scale based on screen size.  \n",
    "   - Minima, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS are all responsive frameworks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Designing with Tailwind CSS**  \n",
    "   - Start by designing with Tailwind CSS to create a flexible UI.  \n",
    "   - Optimize code to avoid unnecessary repetition.  \n",

    "#### Front Matter  \n",
    "- Front matter is a section at the top of a file enclosed in triple dashes (`---`).  \n",
    "- It defines metadata and settings for that page.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Layouts  \n",
    "- A **layout** is a template that determines the structure of a page.  \n",
    "- Layouts can be **cascaded**, meaning one layout can inherit another.  \n",
    "- Themes include **base layouts**, which can be customized.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Layouts in a Page  \n",
    "- Specify the layout in the front matter at the top of a file:  \n",
