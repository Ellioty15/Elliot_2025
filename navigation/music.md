<h1>Pop, Rap</h1>
    <body> Pop, R&B, and Rap are the genres that I listen to most frequently.
<h2> History of Pop</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pop is a genre of music that is often associated with dance and is upbeat in general. Some of my pop artists that I listen to are Jvke, Ariana, and Bruno Mars
        <li>There are also variations of pop, K-pop being a large example, which stand for pop songs that were made in a different country. K-pop stands for Korean pop, and some popular artists are Seventeen or New Jeans.
        <li> It is said that Pop originated around 1950, and takes inspiration from many different genres like Rock and Roll, and Jazz.
        <li> Michael Jackson was dubbed the "King of Pop" because of his influence on the genre.
        <li> Since then, Pop has become much larger and is an ever growing genre.
