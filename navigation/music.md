    <h1>Pop, Rap</h1>
    <p>Pop, R&B, and Rap are the genres that I listen to most frequently.</p>
    <h2>History of Pop</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pop is a genre of music that is often associated with dance and is upbeat in general. Some of my pop artists that I listen to are Jvke, Ariana, and Bruno Mars.</li>
        <li>There are also variations of pop, K-pop being a large example, which stands for pop songs made in a different country. K-pop stands for Korean pop, and some popular artists are Seventeen and New Jeans.</li>
        <li>It is said that Pop originated around 1950 and takes inspiration from many different genres like Rock and Roll, and Jazz.</li>
        <li>Michael Jackson was dubbed the "King of Pop" because of his influence on the genre.</li>
        <li>Since then, Pop has become much larger and is an ever-growing genre.</li>

    <h2>A little bit about Rap</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rap is also referred to as Hip Hop.</li>
        <li>It started showing up around the 1970s.</li>
        <li>Rap involves speaking verses faster than the usual song and often involves rhymes.</li>
        <li>Rap first started as music made by African Americans in the United States, and is still primarily dominated by African Americans, but there are also white rappers.</li>
        <li>Some of my favorite artists in this genre are JID, J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, and more.</li>
