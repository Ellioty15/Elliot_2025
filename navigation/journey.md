<h1>These are the most important steps I took in order to set up my device.</h1>

<ol>
    <li>Download Ubuntu using the command: <code>wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04</code></li>
    <li>After downloading, wait for a prompt and enter a username and password to create the account.</li>
    <li>Type <code>wsl</code> into the terminal to be ready to use Ubuntu Linux/Unix commands.</li>
    <li>Install VS Code from Google.</li>
    <li>Open the Portfolio_2025 repository.</li>
    <li>Check if I have all the tools installed using: <code>ruby -v</code>, <code>bundle -v</code>, <code>jupyter --version</code>, <code>python --version</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Starting a Project</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Move to my home directory using <code>cd</code>.</li>
    <li>Set up a directory for projects with <code>mkdir -p nighthawk</code>, then move to that directory with <code>cd nighthawk</code>. Afterward, clone the student_2025 directory.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Prepare the Project Before Opening VS Code</h2>
<ol> 
    <li>Move to the project directory with <code>cd student_2025</code>, then run <code>bundle install</code>.</li>
    <li>Run the command <code>code .</code> to open VS Code.</li>
    <li>Ensure that when VS Code is opened, the bottom left of VS Code is blue. This indicates that it is connected with WSL.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Sprint 1</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I made several different pages in Sprint 1
        <li>I learned how to link my new files to pages and how to create a permalink
        <li>I added to my about and index pages in order to talk about myself and guide myself throughout my webpage. 
        <li>I created several different games and also a calculator.
        <li>Overall, I had a lot of help from my classmates and learned how to use notebooks, files, and format code, as well as use hyperlinks and buttons in my code.
        </ul>
<h2>Sprint 2</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Our group split the code into 4 different parts. 
        <li>I was in charge of nested if statements and looping with indexes
        <li>I made several homework hacks and made two notebooks that were part of the webpage of our lesson
        </ul>
<h2>Sprint 3</h2>
    <ul>    
        <li>Our group is splitting up into scrum, integrator, backend, and front end. I will be in charge of the backend.
        <li>We setup the flask backend, and we are making our chatroom about underground artists.
        <li>We have cloned our frontend and backend repository and have installed postman
        <li>We worked on our prototype and created a place where we can message 
        <li>we are having merge issues with our frontend so we took some time to fix it
        <li>we were confused about how to make the frontend and backend communicate
        <li>I am collaborating with people from other groups who are in charge of back end in order to connect my frontend to the backend's data.
        <li>With the backend, we will try to track and store messages and users
        <li>We will also try to incorporate a system where people can share some of their favorite songs from underground artists
<body>Big Idea 1.1 Collaboration
Explain how computing innovations are improved through collaboration
Effective collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity and talents of those who designed it.
Collaboration that includes diverse perspectives helps avoid bias during development.
Explain how computing innovations are improved through collaboration.
Think-Pair-Share.  Students think through a problem alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then share results with class..
Two programmers work as a pair on features and ideas.
Online tools to support collaboration (ie Slack), allowing developers to provide feedback and share ideas
Demonstrate effective interpersonal skills during collaboration.
Communication
Consensus Building
Conflict Resolution
Negotiation
Big Idea 1.2 Program Function and Purpose
Describe the purpose of a computing innovation.  
Be sure you can describe the purpose of flocker
What category of innovation is this?  (social media). 
What other categories.
How does understanding the innovation improve the ability to develop?  Here are some considerations.
Identify inputs and type (ie keyboard, touch, camera)
Events that are generated from inputs
Outputs generated from inputs or events
User interface design
User experience design
Coding knowledge
Explain coding in terms of code segment and functions
The behavior of program and how it behaves during execution
Explain frontend coding - how code is organized and runs (inputs and events)
Explain backend coding - how it is distinct from frontend (algorithms and storage)
Big Idea 1.3  Program Design and Development
Develop a program using a Development Process (aka Agile Scrum).  Use a process that is iterative and revision based.
Investigate and reflect
Design / Storyboard
Prototype / Isolate your experiments
Code / Organize into functions and objects
Test, Test, Test / Automate test cases
Repeat
Design a program and its User Interface.
Describe how program will behave
Include list of user interactions
