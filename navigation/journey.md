<h1>These are the most important steps I took in order to set up my device.</h1>

<ol>
    <li>Download Ubuntu using the command: <code>wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04</code></li>
    <li>After downloading, wait for a prompt and enter a username and password to create the account.</li>
    <li>Type <code>wsl</code> into the terminal to be ready to use Ubuntu Linux/Unix commands.</li>
    <li>Install VS Code from Google.</li>
    <li>Open the Portfolio_2025 repository.</li>
    <li>Check if I have all the tools installed using: <code>ruby -v</code>, <code>bundle -v</code>, <code>jupyter --version</code>, <code>python --version</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Starting a Project</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Move to my home directory using <code>cd</code>.</li>
    <li>Set up a directory for projects with <code>mkdir -p nighthawk</code>, then move to that directory with <code>cd nighthawk</code>. Afterward, clone the student_2025 directory.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Prepare the Project Before Opening VS Code</h2>
<ol> 
    <li>Move to the project directory with <code>cd student_2025</code>, then run <code>bundle install</code>.</li>
    <li>Run the command <code>code .</code> to open VS Code.</li>
    <li>Ensure that when VS Code is opened, the bottom left of VS Code is blue. This indicates that it is connected with WSL.</li>
