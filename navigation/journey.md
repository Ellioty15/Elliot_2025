# These are the most important steps I took in order to set up my device.

1. Download Ubuntu using the command: `wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04`.
2. After downloading, wait for a prompt and enter a username and password to create the account.
3. Type `wsl` into the terminal to be ready to use Ubuntu Linux/Unix commands.
4. Install VS Code from Google.
5. Open the Portfolio_2025 repository.
6. Check if I have all the tools installed using:
   - `ruby -v`
   - `bundle -v`
   - `jupyter --version`
   - `python --version`

## Starting a Project

1. Move to my home directory using `cd`.
2. Set up a directory for projects with `mkdir -p nighthawk`, then move to that directory with `cd nighthawk`. Afterward, clone the student_2025 directory.

## Prepare the Project Before Opening VS Code

1. Move to the project directory with `cd student_2025`, then run `bundle install`.
2. Run the command `code .` to open VS Code.
3. Ensure that when VS Code is opened, the bottom left of VS Code is blue. This indicates that it is connected with WSL.

## Sprint 1

- I made several different pages in Sprint 1 and learned how to link my new files to pages and create a permalink.
  - I added to my about and index pages to talk about myself and guide myself throughout my webpage.
  - I created several different games and also a calculator.
  - Overall, I had a lot of help from my classmates and learned how to use notebooks, files, and format code, as well as use hyperlinks and buttons in my code.

## Sprint 2

- Our group split the code into 4 different parts.
  - I was in charge of nested if statements and looping with indexes.
  - I made several homework hacks and created two notebooks that were part of the webpage of our lesson.
  - The homework was difficult but I learned slowly
  - Our presentation went well, and people were able to do their homework
  - I reflected well in my one minute speech

## Sprint 3

- [Link to Project](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/flocker_frontend/undgdmusic/)
- Our group is splitting up into Scrum, Integrator, Backend, and Frontend. I will be in charge of the backend.
  - We set up the Flask backend and are making our chatroom about underground artists.
  - We cloned our frontend and backend repository and installed Postman.
  - We worked on our prototype and created a place where we can message.
  - We encountered merge issues with our frontend, so we spent some time fixing them.
  - We were confused about how to make the frontend and backend communicate.
  - I collaborated with people from other groups who are in charge of the backend to connect my frontend to the backend's data.
  - With the backend, we are trying to track and store messages and users.
  - We are also trying to incorporate a system where people can share some of their favorite songs from underground artists.
  - We connected the backend to the frontend, but for some reason only my localhost can do the dropdown for channels.
  - Changes are showing in the backend.
  - Our group has implemented functions for sharing music.
  - We have a way to show artists and details on small artists.
