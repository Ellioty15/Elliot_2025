# Setting up VSCode
Starting with the VSCode was my first challenge:
- My first week my VSCode didn't work, and I was running powershell as an administrator
- My actual computer files were showing up instead of my navigation and webpage
With help, I learned how to setup correctly through powershell without running as administrator, and when I opened up VSCode, WSL was connceted correctly.

# Buttons, Links, Embeds
- I added buttons, but they were not taking me to anywhere
- I linked the buttons to my pages and they started working
- I also wanted my links and buttons to open new tabs instead of taking me ot the website in my site, and I fixed the issue
- I found spotify embed codes and added that to my code to embed multiple playlists

# Creating a New Page in HTML
- I didn't know what pages to add, and why they weren't linking correctly 
- My links were broken because I didn't understand that I needed to connect through config.yml
- when I deployed, the page didn't look correct, but after fixing the three places to my repository name the webpage deployed correctly

# Embedding an Image
- I first tried uploading images through my downloads, but I didn't understand how that worked.
- I soon understood that I can embed my images through links
- from there, I learned to change the images so that I could crop out certain parts and change the size
- with this knowledge, I proceeded to add images to my home page through google drive

# Learning to Make a Game

- This was mostly a process of trial and error
- I constantly changed the style of my games to what I wanted to look
- I uploaded my own images so that the games would look less boring
- I spent a couple hours adding all the games until they had the functions that I wanted.
